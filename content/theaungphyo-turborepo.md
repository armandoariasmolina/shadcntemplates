## Overview

The NestJS & NextJS Boilerplate with Turborepo is a powerful framework designed for developers looking to streamline their web applications using a monorepo approach. By integrating high-performance tools such as NestJS for backend services and NextJS for frontend applications, it creates an efficient workflow that can be appreciated by both seasoned developers and those new to the technology. The boilerplate offers a well-defined structure and pre-configured tools that can save a significant amount of development time, allowing developers to focus on building rather than setting up.

This setup not only simplifies the management and deployment of applications but also incorporates modern technology standards. With features that cater to security, efficiency, and scalability, this boilerplate is an excellent choice for individuals or teams who want to create robust applications without the overhead of configuration complexities.

## Features

- **NestJS Backend**: Utilizes NestJS v11 for building a dynamic and robust backend service that allows for efficient API design.

- **NextJS Frontend**: Incorporates NextJS v15 to create a responsive and fast user interface with server-side rendering capabilities.

- **SWC Transpilation**: Employs SWC for quick and seamless TypeScript and JavaScript transpilation, enhancing the build process speed.

- **Efficient Dependency Management**: Implements pnpm to handle dependencies effectively, resulting in reduced installation times and optimized storage.

- **JWT Authentication**: Features JWT access and refresh token mechanisms to ensure secure and authenticated API communication.

- **PostgreSQL with TypeORM**: Leverages PostgreSQL as the database solution, utilizing TypeORM for robust and flexible data management.

- **Email Services**: Uses Nodemailer to manage email functionalities, making it easy to integrate email notifications into your application.

- **Micro-Frontend Architecture**: Supports a micro-frontend approach through Turborepo, promoting reusability and organization across different applications in the monorepo.
