## Overview
Cella is a sophisticated template designed to facilitate the development of web applications with advanced synchronization capabilities and offline support. Built using a robust stack including PostgreSQL, Node.js, Hono, Drizzle, React, Electric-Sync, and TanStack, this template empowers developers to create dynamic applications that can operate seamlessly in both online and offline environments. Cella aims to streamline the web app development process by providing an implementation-ready structure that allows for rapid customization and feature enhancement.

The main purpose of Cella is to provide developers with a powerful foundation for building applications that require real-time data synchronization and resilience against network interruptions. By integrating cutting-edge technologies, Cella ensures that developers can focus on delivering unique functionality while leveraging a well-architected framework that supports complex use cases.

## Features
