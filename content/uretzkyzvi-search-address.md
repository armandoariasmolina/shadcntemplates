## Overview
Built with React and leveraging the power of the Nominatim service from OpenStreetMap, this component offers an engaging user experience through features such as autocomplete search and interactive result displays. It is particularly beneficial for applications that require location-based services, allowing users to find and select addresses seamlessly.

With an open-source distribution, the Search Address component encourages community contribution and collaboration. It integrates well with shadcn-ui for UI elements and lucide-react for icons, making it a flexible option for developers who want to maintain a modern aesthetic in their projects. The component is designed to improve performance and usability, streamlining the address search process while providing valuable functionalities for end-users.

## Features
- **Autocomplete Search**: The component provides real-time suggestions as users type their queries, significantly enhancing the user experience by reducing the need for complete address inputs.

- **Grouped Results**: Search results are organized by address type, allowing users to easily navigate and select the exact location they are searching for, which makes it user-friendly and efficient.

- **Interactive UI**: Results are displayed in a responsive popover that allows users to select addresses via click or touch, catering to both desktop and mobile users.

- **Debounced Input**: The input field utilizes debouncing, which minimizes the frequency of search requests, improving overall application performance and responsiveness.

- **Multiple Providers Support**: The component supports various geocoding providers through the leaflet-geosearch library, offering flexibility in how addresses are resolved and displayed.

- **Easy Integration**: Developers can quickly integrate the Search Address component into their projects with minimal setup, thanks to clear installation instructions and dependency requirements.

- **Dynamic Imports**: The component supports dynamic imports with server-side rendering (SSR) disabled, helping to avoid common issues such as the "window is not defined" error.

- **Custom Hooks**: It comes with custom hooks, including `useDebounce` and `useSearchAddress`, which provide additional functionality and can be easily reused across different components.

- **Open Source**: As an open-source project, it invites contributions from the developer community, ensuring continual improvements and feature additions based on user feedback.

- **Documentation and Support**: Comprehensive documentation is provided, guiding developers through installation, usage, and customization of the component to fit their specific needs.
