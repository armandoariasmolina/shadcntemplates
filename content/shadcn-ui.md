## Overview

shadcn/ui is a set of components for React, built on Radix UI and styled with Tailwind CSS. Shadcn redefines how developers use UI component libraries by shifting from traditional npm packages to a **copy-paste** model. This approach gives developers full control over their components while eliminating dependency bloat and update issues. Additionally, shadcn/ui introduces a **component registry**, allowing users to browse, pull, and customize high-quality components effortlessly.

## Features

- **Copy-Paste Model** – Components are added directly to projects, ensuring full ownership and flexibility.
- **Component Registry** – Developers can browse and pull pre-built components while maintaining full customization.
- **No External Dependencies** – Unlike traditional UI libraries, shadcn/ui components are self-contained, reducing update conflicts.
- **Tailwind and Radix UI-Based** – Components are styled with Tailwind CSS and built on Radix UI for accessibility and consistency.
- **Fully Customizable** – Since components are part of the project code, they can be modified without restrictions.
- **Lightweight and Fast** – No extra dependencies mean a leaner, more efficient codebase.

## Philosophy

Shadcn UI flips the script by treating components as open code, designed to be copied, customized, and fully owned by you. It follows several key principles:

- **Editable Code** – No black-box components. You can modify, extend, and adapt every element.
- **Composable API** – A unified structure across all components makes them predictable and easy to use.
- **Self-Hosted & Distributed** – A CLI tool helps manage components across projects without relying on external packages.
- **Beautiful by Default** – Thoughtfully designed styles ensure a polished UI out of the box.

## AI-Optimized and Future-Proof

Shadcn UI is optimized for AI, thanks to its strategic partnership with v0 and Next.js, leveraging the power of AI in both design and development workflows. This optimization is driven by using ShadCcn components as a training dataset, making the entire codebase easily understandable and adaptable for AI models.
